LycanitesTweaks

A 1.12.2 mod that includes patches and tweaks to LycanitesMobs

Patches are intended to be migrated to LycanitesMobs itself while any tweaks that are outside LycanitesMobs will remain here.

This branch is meant to be used as reference in order to aid the development an entity that inherits BaseCreatureEntity. Implementation is quick and dirty, but will load into the game.
